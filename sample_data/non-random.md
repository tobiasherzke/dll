The fluctuations in timestamp differences in file `bpi-r48-p96.mat` shown in this plot
![](bpi-r48-p96.png) are not randomm fluctuations as can be seen when plotting the same data as a scatter plot:
```
load bpi-r48-p96.mat;
plot(diff(timestamper),'.');title 'diff(timestamps)', xlabel 'n^{th} processing callback', ylabel 'timestamp difference / s'
```

The timestamp differences show some major quantization and some minor additional noise. The quant size can be computed as
```
median(diff(timestamper)(diff(timestamper)>0.002)) - median(diff(timestamper)(diff(timestamper)<0.002))
```
which is 158.31Î¼s.  However, neither median is an integral
multiple of the quant size.

Zooming in on the first plot shows that the time difference
alternates between the longer and the shorter quantization:
